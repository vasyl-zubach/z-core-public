# Z-Core (public)

`Z-Core` is my big monorepo where I collected all of my scripts, components, tools, todo lists of ideas, etc. It's private, and will remain private for now. To share and publish some parts of it, as a starting point, I'll sync parts that can be shared publicly into [vasyl-zubach/z-core-public](https://github.com/vasyl-zubach/z-core-public). Eventually, I'll make it sync all the public stuff and tooling to get that public repo in working condition.

At some point, I hope it'll become bi-directionally synced 🤞 (I just need to learn how to do that 😉)

Packages will be published under `@z-core` npm scope.
